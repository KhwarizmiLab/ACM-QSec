The inaugural **Quantum Security and Privacy (QSec) Workshop** invites contributions at the intersection of quantum technologies and security and privacy, with a particular focus on securing end-to-end systems and safeguarding data and code in the quantum computing era. The workshop will explore both the evolving landscape of quantum threats (posed by adversaries with quantum computing or sensing capabilities) and the expanding landscape of threats **to** quantum technologies (posed by classical or quantum adversaries). Participants will also present countermeasures and innovative solutions—ranging from hybrid cryptographic schemes to protocols protecting fragile near-term quantum systems.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on all aspects of quantum security and privacy, including but not limited to:

### Security and Privacy of Communication
- Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure channels  
- Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) implementations in networking  
- Hybrid quantum-classical cryptographic architectures  
- Quantum-enabled authentication, identity management, and access control mechanisms  

### Experimental and Theoretical Quantum Security
- Formal analysis of quantum security models and protocols  
- Experimental demonstrations of quantum-secure systems  
- Benchmarking quantum cryptographic protocols and security measures  

### Security and Privacy of Applications
- Algorithms and frameworks for quantum-resistant network security  
- Privacy in quantum-enhanced data processing and storage  
- Quantum methods for securing decentralized systems (e.g., blockchain)  
- Privacy-preserving techniques for quantum-enhanced AI and machine learning  

### Privacy and Ethical Considerations
- Ethical implications of quantum computing for user privacy  
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies for quantum-enhanced systems  
- Legal and regulatory challenges in deploying quantum security technologies
